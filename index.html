        <h1>Comparing Apples To Oranges Using Machine Learning</h1>
      </div>
    </b>
    <p id= "description">In one sentence, Machine Learning is giving a computer a dataset and having it draw mathmatical conclusions from it. 
    In our case, we are giving the computer the colors of oranges and apples and we want the computer to (hopefully) "figure" out that apples are red and oranges are orange.
    While this sounds incredibly simple as a human who already knows this, a computer doesn't "know" what an orange is or any of the qualities it posses.
    So we have to teach it. On the left side of the <a href=" https://www.desmos.com/calculator/9aew4lvzpw">Desmos graph</a> there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_set">training set</a> or set of data about various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)">features</a> of apples and oranges. Apples are denoted as having a Y value of 0 and oranges have a Y value of 1.
    On the x axis, we put the amount of redness in each sample of an apple or orange. it turns out for RGB values, an orange has more red than an apple!
    So first, we graph it and then get the line of best fit for the points. Now we can see that all of the oranges are the points at the top right of the graph and the apples are the points at the bottom left.
    We can plug in an x value to the line and it will give us a Y value. With a little bit of math the Y value will give us a percentage of how certain or close a input object is to either an apple or orange. 
    We have effectivley "taught" the computer what apples and oranges are and how to figure out if an object is an apple or an orange. This is the most simple a machine learning algorithim can get as many go deep into linear alegebra and vector math, but, this algorithim is great for understanding basic theory.
    At the bottom is a box where you can insert a picture of an apple or orange and the algorithim should tell you which fruit it is. </p>
